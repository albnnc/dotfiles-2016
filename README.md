## Alex Quot's Dotfiles

This repo consists of various dotfiles and relies on some external
projects, so be cautious when using it. Please, if you use some code,
look inside each file for possible statements or license headers.

Great things used:

* [Vim hybrid theme](https://github.com/w0ng/vim-hybrid);
* [Numix](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-gtk-theme) GTK themes
(both 2 and 3) and Numix Openbox theme (as a base for the Hybrid Openbox
theme);
* [vim.cpp](https://github.com/octol/vim-cpp-enhanced-highlight);
* the wallpaper (*openbox/wallpaper.jpg*) was taken from
[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) and created by
[Ales Krivec](https://unsplash.com/@aleskrivec).

## Installation

Of course, everything could be installed manually by simply copying the
files, but [Blossom](https://github.com/alexquot/blossom) is the preferred
installation tool.

#### Notes
* *ext* folder consists of files which wouldn't be installed automatically,
even with Blossom (it's possible, but I don't want to abuse some
directories because of safety). Usually these are configs from various
*/etc* folders.
